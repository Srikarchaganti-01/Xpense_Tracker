## Data Organization (Folder-like Structure)

* **Month (current calendar month)**

  * **Week (calendar weeks: Monday → Sunday)**

    * **Day**

      * List of individual expenses for that day

## Technical Decisions

* Uses **local Storage** only
* No user accounts or multi-user separation

* Focus on clean JS logic and data handling

If you want, next we can:

* convert this into a **clean data structure**
* or turn this into a **step-by-step build plan**
